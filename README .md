Assumptions and Reasons:
Menu Image Availability: Assumption: Restaurant menus in Mumbai are available online and can be accessed and scraped. Reason: Many restaurants publish their menus online for customers to view and order from, making them accessible for scraping.

OCR Accuracy: Assumption: The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology used will have a high accuracy rate in reading text from menu images. Reason: High accuracy is necessary to extract menu items and prices correctly from menu images for further processing and storage.

Database Choice: Assumption: Any type of database can be used to store the extracted items and prices. Reason: The choice of database may depend on the scalability, performance, and other requirements of the application, so keeping the database choice flexible allows for adaptation to different scenarios.

Technology Stack: Assumption: The application will be built using Spring Boot for the backend. Reason: Spring Boot provides a robust and easy-to-use framework for building Java applications, making it suitable for developing the image server.

Web Scraping: Assumption: Web scraping will be used to extract menu images from restaurant websites. Reason: Web scraping is a common technique for extracting data from websites and is necessary to obtain menu images for OCR processing.

OCR Library: Assumption: Tess4J, a Java wrapper for Tesseract OCR, will be used for OCR processing. Reason: Tess4J provides a reliable and accurate OCR solution that can be easily integrated into Java applications.

Database Storage: Assumption: Extracted menu items and prices will be stored in a relational database. Reason: A relational database is suitable for storing structured data such as menu items and prices, allowing for efficient querying and management.

Error Handling: Assumption: Error handling will be implemented to manage exceptions during scraping, OCR processing, and database operations. Reason: Error handling is essential to ensure the stability and reliability of the application, especially when dealing with external resources and complex operations.

Security: Assumption: Basic security measures such as input validation and data sanitization will be implemented to prevent common security vulnerabilities. Reason: Security is crucial to protect the application from malicious attacks and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data.

Scalability: Assumption: The application will be designed to handle a moderate amount of traffic and data volume. Reason: Scalability is important to accommodate potential growth in users and data without compromising performance.
